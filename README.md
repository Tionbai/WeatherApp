# Weather App

Weather App is a simple `React App` that fetches current weather information from `OpenWeatherMap API`.

## Installation

Clone this repository. You will need node and npm installed globally on your machine.

### Installation:

```bash
npm install
```

### To start server:

```bash
npm start
```

### To visit app:

```bash
localhost:3000
```

## Usage

The app shows a `form` where you can type in a `city name` or `use location` to fetch the current weather information for the given city location.

`Use location` requires that you give the app access to your current location.

You need a valid `API key` to get real weather data. The app is set up so you will get mock weather data without a key, for example purposes.

You can get a free `API key` from
